# 5. Robot Simulator

This is an exercise number 5 from exam conducted after 1st month of Scala Academy at [Adform](https://github.com/adform).

### Task description
Write a robot simulator.

A robot factory's test facility needs a program to verify robot movements.

The robots have three possible movements:
- turn right
- turn left
- advance

Robots are placed on a hypothetical infinite grid, facing a particular direction (`north`, `east`, `south`, or `west`) at a set of `{x,y}` coordinates, e.g., `{3,8}`, with coordinates increasing to the `north` and `east`.

The robot then receives a number of instructions, at which point the testing facility verifies the robot's new position, and in which direction it is pointing.

The letter-string `RAALAL` means:
- Turn right
- Advance twice
- Turn left
- Advance once
- Turn left yet again

Say a robot starts at `{7, 3}` facing `north`. Then running this stream of instructions should leave it at `{9, 4}` facing west.
